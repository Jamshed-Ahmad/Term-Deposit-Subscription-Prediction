# 🔮 Term Deposit Subscription Prediction: Unlocking Data-Driven Marketing Success 🚀

## 🔍 Project Overview <br>
Welcome to the future of banking marketing! This project harnesses the power of machine learning to predict the likelihood of customers subscribing to a term deposit after a marketing call, providing banks with a data-driven approach to maximize conversion rates and tailor campaigns effectively.

## ✨ What Makes This Project Stand Out? <br>
💡 Smart Data Engineering: From handling missing data to creating impactful features, every step is meticulously designed to ensure the dataset is primed for model training.<br>
🤖 Cutting-Edge ML Models: Tested multiple state-of-the-art algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to find the perfect match for this predictive task. The goal? Achieving unparalleled prediction accuracy!<br>
🎯 Precision Performance Metrics: Evaluated models based on a comprehensive set of metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC—to ensure that the model not only performs well but is also reliable and impactful.<br>
🌐 Interactive Experience: Built an intuitive Gradio interface to bring machine learning into the hands of anyone. Now you can input real-world data and get instant predictions on whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit!<br>
📈 Real-World Impact: This project empowers financial institutions to improve customer targeting and boost marketing ROI by identifying individuals most likely to engage with term deposit offers.<br>

## 📂 Dataset & Features <br>
The dataset contains various attributes affecting house prices, including: <br>
| Feature Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------| 
age | Investment tendency varies with age <br>
job | Occupation affects financial stability <br>
marital | Financial priorities differ by status <br>
education | Higher education may mean better financial awareness <br>
default | Credit defaulters are less likely to invest <br>
balance | Higher balance increases investment likelihood <br>
housing | Housing loans may reduce deposit interest<br>
loan | Existing loans lower investment probability<br>
contact | Communication type influences response<br>
duration | Longer calls = higher conversion chances<br>
campaign | Too many calls may reduce interest<br>
pdays | Recent contacts can impact decisions<br>
previous | Past engagement increases likelihood<br>
poutcome | Previous success boosts future success<br>

## 📊 Model Performance & Accuracy <br>
| Model | Accuracy (R² Score) |
|-------|---------------------|
Logistic Regression | 80.0% <br>
SVM | 58.0% <br>
Random Forest | 93.0% ✅ (Best Model) 

🔹 Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest accuracy (89.6%), making it the optimal choice for predictions. <br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Project <br>
### 1️⃣ Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Bank Term Deposit Subscription Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to:
   - Perform data preprocessing and EDA.
   - Train and evaluate different regression models.
   - Compare accuracy metrics.

 ### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies 
 pip install `-r requirements.txt`. 

### 3️⃣ Run the Gradio App 
`python app.py`. <br>
or, if using Jupyter Notebook: <br>
`!gradio app.py`. 

The Gradio interface will launch in your browser, allowing you to predict house prices dynamically. 

###🌟 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced ensemble models 🏆.
🔹 Integrate real-time market trends 📈.
🔹 Deploy as a full-fledged web application 🌐.
